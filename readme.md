### Background

This _Gatsby_ code is for serving the content from the _WordPress_ website I had for many years.

### Notes

If `npm run build` errors out, try deleting the `.cache` and `public`

### Credits

This _Gatsby.js_ website is based off the [gatsby-universal](https://github.com/fabe/gatsby-universal) starter.
