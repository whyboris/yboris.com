I became a vegan / vegetarian after I learned more about the way animals are currently raised in factory farms. I do not think that the pleasure of eating a single meal of meat *instead of a non-meat dish* can outweigh the bad of inflicting several months of painful experiences on a sentient being.

Vegetarian and vegan meals, done well, are absolutely amazing; see for yourself:
