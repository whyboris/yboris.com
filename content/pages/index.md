Thanks for visiting my website.

I’m happy to be a part of the [Effective Altruism](http://effective-altruism.com/) movement, following the [Earning to Give](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earning_to_give) strategy which means I give at least 10% of my income to the most *cost-effective* charity I can find. In 2012 I [gave 50%](http://www.boldergiving.org/stories.php?story=Boris_Yakubchik) to [Against Malaria Foundation](http://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=6527). At the moment I’m back to giving only 10% of my income as I have some extra expenses. I give because I realized it is the most positive impact I can make in this world. When you give money to a charity that uses research-proven methods, you can help people tremendously: cure a case of blindness for [$35](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-area/blindness), prevent a case of malaria for [$1.80](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf), and rid a child of parasitic worms for [$0.50](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative)…

I’ve made giving a part of my life because there is absolutely nothing I can do with a few hundred dollars for myself that will be as valuable as preventing a needless death and providing a healthy productive life in its stead.
