### Birthday for charity

It’s been inspiring to see that simply by having a “**Birthday for Charity**” one can do so much good. I’ve encouraged my friends who want to give me a gift on my birthday to instead give to my favorite charity instead. With this, I was able to raise lots of money for my favorite charity, the *Against Malaria Foundation*. Here is the tally for the last 3 years:

- [2012](http://www.againstmalaria.com/yboris2012) — $ 2,144.57
- [2013](http://www.againstmalaria.com/yboris2013) — $ 1,244.49
- [2014](http://www.againstmalaria.com/yboris2014) — $ 493.65
- [2015](http://www.againstmalaria.com/yboris2015) — $ 297.91

Thank you all for having participated in these ❤

It’s not very obvious why the amounts have decreased over the years, but I suspect the 2014 amount is so much lower because of poor promotion. In 2013 I created a Facebook event for an actual party happening at my house and invited all 1,400+ friends I have on Facebook. Most couldn’t attend, but chose to give a gift anyway. In 2014 I didn’t have such an event.

The **[Against Malaria Foundation](http://againstmalaria.com/)** (AMF) distributes anti-mosquito bednets that protect people from malaria. This is a [research-based](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/amf) cost-effective way to prevent the disease. Every $3 you give to AMF, you protect on average 2 people for the next 5 years from malaria! This means children won’t be sick and will go to school more, and adults won’t be sick and not miss work-days. Everyone wins!
