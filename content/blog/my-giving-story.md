*My personal story*

I can’t stop giving, I now give 50% of my income to the most cost-effective charity I can find.

It wasn’t always like this. My parents never gave to charity, and my first donation was probably mid-college after I read Peter Singer’s seminal essay [Famine, Affluence, and Morality](http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1972----.htm). I decided to start giving because I realized I could do so much more good for someone else with my $10 than I could do for myself.

Later, after college, I learned about [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), an organization of people who give at least 10% of their income to charities that reduce extreme world poverty. I was astounded to learn that by giving to the most cost-effective charities, instead of the regular ones, [my $10 could do as much good as $10,000](http://givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give)!

This inspired me to not only give more, but to give more-effectively. After joining Giving What We Can I learned about [Bolder Giving](http://boldergiving.org/), and was inspired by some of [their stories](http://boldergiving.org/stories.php?story=97).

Having made giving a habit, and thus a more-central part of my life, I decided to join [Bolder Giving](http://boldergiving.org/stories.php?story=Boris) as well.

I can’t think of anything better to do with my life than to help people in the most effective way I can find. When my $1,000 donation can [cure 2,000 people of parasitic worms for a full year](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/SCI), or [protect about 360 people from malaria for the next five years](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF), I’m inspired to give more!

Starting to give is easy. For several years now I’ve been having a “Birthday for Charity” – I ask my friends who wish to give me gifts, to make a donation to my favorite charity instead. Last year I managed to[raise over $2,000](http://www.againstmalaria.com/Fundraiser.aspx?FundraiserID=6560)!

Start small, start today. Give, but make sure you [do some research](http://www.givewell.org/), others’ lives depend on it!
