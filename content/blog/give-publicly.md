*Give publicly, to inspire others!*

Giving shouldn’t be done in secret. When you give to a cause, it’s hopefully because you want that cause to succeed, and its success matters. Hopefully you’ve done [research](http://www.givewell.org/) and think the charity you endorse is awesome. So why not discuss with others what you think really matters? Most people already give to charity, do you wonder if the charity they support does more good than the charity you support? Wouldn’t you want to do more good with every donation you make?

Perhaps more importantly, when you have conversations about giving, you could inspire others to give more! Perhaps you will be inspired to give more, and everyone wins.

I was deeply inspired, and now I give 50% of my income to the most cost-effective charities I can find; and I do it [publicly](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-01-15/to-inspire-people-to-give-be-public).

Turns out there is a huge number of people who give at least [1% of their income to charity](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/), a large number of people who give at least[ 10% of their income to charity](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) and there are many who either [give 50% of their income](http://boldergiving.org/)or wealth.

All those are inspiring to me; if it wasn’t for them, I would have still been giving a miserly fraction of my income, and worse yet – to charities that weren’t as good as those that have the best [evidence on their side](http://www.givewell.org/).
