*Give, because you’re richer than you ever imagined!*

If you earn an income at the poverty level in America ($11,170), you’re already in the richest 12% of the world’s population! And if you earn the average income in the US ($41,000), you’re earning more than 99% of the world’s population! [You are the 1%](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-give/how-rich-am-i), like it or not.

How could this be? Simple: the vast majority of people in the world are obscenely poor. There are about three billion people in the world that live on less than $2/day. This figure does not mean “what I can buy in that country for $2 USD”, but instead has already been adjusted for the value of currency.

**That means about three billion people live as well in their countries as you would if you had less than $2 living in the United States at your disposal every day.**

All this means that even if you choose to give 50% of your income, you will still be in the richest 5% of the world’s population. Even if you give only 10% of your income, as long as you give to the most [cost-effective charities](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/our-research/the-moral-imperative-towards-cost-effectiveness), you will be able to do an immense amount of good.

*How about curing over [8,000 people of parasitic worms](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/where-to-give/recommended-charities#sci) every year that you chose to give 10% of your average-income-in-the-US salary?*
